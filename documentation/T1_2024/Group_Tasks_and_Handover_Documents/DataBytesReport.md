**Project 1 DolFin**

**Overview, Goals, and Objectives**

DolFin is an innovative financial well-being platform that integrates
open banking data and leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to streamline financial
management, offer personalized forecasts and advice, and deliver these
insights through a smart chatbot interface.

At the heart of the DolFin project is the ambition to overcome the
limitations of the traditional banking system, characterized by
monopolistic behaviours and unequal service provision to different
demographics. By offering an open, accessible platform, DolFin aims to
enable effective financial management for everyone, regardless of their
economic status.

The long-term goals of the DolFin project extend beyond immediate
financial management aid. It aims to foster financial literacy,
encourage healthy financial habits, and ultimately contribute to
reducing the economic inequality gap. By empowering users with knowledge
and tools to make informed financial decisions, DolFin intends to create
a more inclusive financial ecosystem that benefits everyone, not just
those who can afford traditional advisory services.

The stakeholders of the DolFin project include Deakin Capstone students,
who are integral to its development and implementation; the company
director, who oversees the strategic direction of the project; Deakin
staff, who provide academic support and guidance; and, most importantly,
individuals seeking to improve their financial well-being. For these
stakeholders, DolFin promises not only to revolutionize the way they
interact with their finances but also to provide them with a platform
that supports their financial growth and resilience.
