As we have done in previous trimesters, we've decided to repeat the practice of getting a Dolfin wishlist to help student leaders to plan for the development of the project throughout next trimester. 
The wishlist is yours to contribute your ideas on what you think the project lacks and should implement - a new feature? A different theme? It's up to you, just be sure to include a description. 

## Wishlist Table 

| Feature | Streams | Description |
|:--------|:---------|:-----------|
| Structured Logging | CS/BE | Introduce structured logging into the current logging function so that analysis of logs becomes more effective. |
