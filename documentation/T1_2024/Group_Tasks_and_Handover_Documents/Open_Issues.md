| Heera Mohanadas | CS/BE | <p>The log file no longer reflects user authentication. It previously recorded when a user was successfully authenticated and reflected that in the master log (dolfin.log) but it no longer does so. It does reflect the user ID of the user being signed out though. It's a matter of being unable to read the user ID in the first sign-in successful authentication instance. I think something broke when the login system changed to using email to login. </p> |
