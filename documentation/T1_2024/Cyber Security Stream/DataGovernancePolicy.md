# Procedure: Data Governance 

## SECTION 1 -- Data Custodianship and Roles 

(14) The area of custodianship is determined by Dolfin Business Domains
     outlined in the Enterprise Information Model.

(15) Data Custodianship is facilitated by:

     a.  Data Custodian: responsible for overseeing all administrative
         and/or operational aspects of the Business Domain; and

     b.  Data Steward: designated by the Custodian and assists Custodian
         in carrying out day-to-day custodianship-related tasks.

(16) Data Custodianship aims to guarantee that organisational data
     complies with all relevant internal and external laws, rules and
     standards.

(17) Within their Business Domain, Data Custodians are responsible for:

     a.  Shared Dolfin Data Stores which are repositories for
         institutional data management and storage intended to assist
         data analytics and institutional reporting.

     b.  Dolfin Source Systems that are employed in a Business Domain to
         carry out regular business operations.

(18) The Chief Information Officer and Director of Data Analytics
     collaborate to nominate individuals to the data governance
     responsibilities.

## SECTION 2 -- Data Management 

(19) Every piece of organisational data has to be:

     a.  categorised using the Enterprise Information Model.

     b.  comply with the categorisation, storage, security, and Dolfin
         Data Architecture guidelines.

### Data Classification 

(20) The Data Classification Scheme should be followed for classifying
     organisational data, and one of the following four categorisations
     levels should be assigned:

     a.  protected

     b.  confidential

     c.  internal only (by default)

     d.  Open

(21) The internal only categorisation level will be applied by default
     to any data that has not been assigned to one of the four
     categories.

(22) The more restricted classification level has to be used if the data
     may be classified into more than one classification level.

(23) When assigning a classification level to data within their Business
     Domain, the Data Custodian must take into account the following
     factors:

     a.  the asset's value and/or sensitivity, as well as the level of
         protection to be used;

     b.  the asset's confidentiality, integrity and availability;

     c.  the intended distribution with regard to the asset's
         confidentiality, integrity, and availability profile;

     d.  striking a balance between the intended outcomes and the
         day-to-day requirements of operations management; and

     e.  modification possibility after the initial data classification.

(24) The following parties must be consulted before institutional data
     is categorised as Confidential or Protected or before any data is
     modified from these classification levels:

     a.  Legal Services

     b.  The Privacy Officer

(25) The more restrictive categorisation level needs to be used in cases
     when there is a conflict between contractual, legal, or regulatory
     obligations.

(26) All information belonging to Dolfin must be stored safely and
     shielded against illegal use, access and disclosure.

(27) Data Stewards are in charge of authorising new or modified user
     access in accordance with each user's unique function.

(28) Access to data must be granted, changed, or revoked through a
     formal registration process that complies with the Data Security
     Policy.

(29) Data Stewards are responsibility for routinely auditing user access
     in collaboration with the Information Services Security team.

(30) Employees are in charge of safeguarding the organisation's data
     stores and are required to implement good data security practices,
     which include:

     a.  preventing unauthorised access to dashboards, reports or raw
         data, regardless of the device or location;

     b.  producing reports that adhere to privacy principles;

     c.  distributing reports, analysis, and data only to authorised
         recipients;

     d.  upholding the data classification and protection levels in
         reports and output generated throughout the data lifecycle; and

     e.  reporting any detected or suspected data security events or
         weaknesses to the appropriate Data Steward.

(31) The maintenance of data classification levels and the regular
     monitoring of compliance with the data classification levels used
     in reporting and analytics are the responsibilities of Data
     Custodians and/or Data Stewards.

### Data Security Events or Weaknesses

(32) Information system or service users are required to promptly notify
     the appropriate Data Steward of any discovered or suspected
     security incidents or vulnerabilities.

(33) The user of Data Steward should notify the Incident Response
     Liaison in line with Dolfin's *Incident Response Policy* in the
     event that an actual, prospective, or suspected data security
     incident involving personal information.

(34) The **Incident Response Liaison** can be reached at: (03) 1800 765
     from 7:00am -- 7:00pm AEST Sunday to Saturday unless otherwise
     notified.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Dolfin Data Governance Policy and Data Governance Procedure were
made with reference to La Trobe's Data Governance Policy, Australia
National University's Data Governance Policy, various Data Policies of
financial institutions including, but not limited to, Westpac Group and
ANZ, OECD Digital Guide to Data Governance Policy, OECD Data Governance
general resources, Westpac Group Consumer Data Right Policy and more.

In compliance with Public Governance, Performance and Accountability
Rule 2014 and Privacy Act 1988. Doublecheck other sources of regulations
this needs to be in compliance with.

# ASSUMPTIONS 

The assumption made for this policy is that Dolfin operates as its own
corporation, a subsidiary of the Databytes company. Moreover, it is
assumed that the roles discussed are present and available in the
company at the time of the policy's and procedure's implementation. It
is also assumed that the policy and procedure were already given the
approval of Dolfin owners and related board members.

There are assumptions made, with reference throughout the policy and
procedure made to a "Data Security Policy", "Information Services
Security team", "Privacy Officer" and other roles and job descriptions
that such roles do or will exist at the time of the policy's creation
and implementation.

There is a pre-existing Business Enterprise Model that covers Dolfin's
Business Domains, including, but not limited to, Human Resources,
Information Security, and Administration.
