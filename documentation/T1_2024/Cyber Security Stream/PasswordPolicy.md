Dolfin Password Policy

Overview: The Password Policy identifies requirements of password
complexity, management, and expiration. These all work to add an extra
layer of security to the application's user accounts. The policy covers
the aims of deactivation of user accounts with old, "expired" passwords. 

Also: This was created by Mariska Heera Mohanadas, senior. There were images in the original documents, pdf versions can be found on teams with the images included.

# Part 1 - Recitals

## Purpose

1)  The policy aims to establish guidelines for the creation and
    management of passwords to ensure the security and confidentiality
    of Dolfin systems and data.

2)  By enforcing strong password practices, Dolfin aims to mitigate the
    risk of unauthorised access, data breaches, and other security
    incidents.

## Scope

3)  The policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants,
    temporary workers, and other personnel who have access to Dolfin's
    information systems, and data.

4)  Paragraphs 6 to 8 of the policy applies to all users of the Dolfin
    application. All other paragraphs do not apply to Dolfin application
    consumers.

5)  The policy covers all passwords used to access Dolfin resources, for
    example, computers, emails accounts, and networks.

# Part 2 - Policy Statement 

## Password Creation and Complexity

6)  To deter brute-force attacks of user and staff accounts, password
    creation and complexity requirements aim to increase the number of
    possible passwords.

7)  Passwords must meet the following guidelines:

    a.  The password must contain 12 - 20 characters.

    b.  The password must consist of a mix of lowercase letters,
        uppercase letters, special characters (such as **. \#**) and
        numbers.

8)  Password creation recommendations are as follows:

    a.  Avoid commonly used or easily guessed password (e.g.,
        "password123").

    b.  Passwords should not be based on your personal information, such
        as your name, birthday, email address, or address.

    c.  Passwords should be easy for their user to remember.

    d.  Passwords should be unique to the Dolfin account, and not a
        password shared or associated with other user accounts.

## Password Management

9)  Employees must not share their passwords with anyone, including IT
    personnel and other staff members.

10) Passwords should not be written down or stored in an unsecure
    position.

11) Passwords are to be regularly changed, at least every 90 days, or as
    otherwise required.

12) Do not reuse passwords for multiple accounts.

## Authentication Factors

13) Where feasible, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be
    implemented.

14) Beyond passwords, MFA adds an extra security layer to user account
    verification and authentication.

15) MFA may include something you know (passcode), something you have
    (authentication token), or something you are (biometric
    authentication).

## Account Lockout and Password Recovery

16) Provide secure password recovery mechanisms that do not compromise
    confidentiality of passwords.

    a.  Potential methods of implementation include:

        i.  One-time passwords sent to registered and verified email
            addresses or phone numbers.

        ii. Security questions.

17) Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of
    failed logins to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Password Storage and Transmission

18) Industry-standard encryption algorithms are used to store passwords.

19) Passwords are transmitted over secure, encrypted connections only
    (e.g. HTTPS).

## Employee Training and Awareness

20) Provide regular training to employees on password best practices,
    including the

    a.  importance of password hygiene,

    b.  risks associated with password sharing and reuse, and

    c.  best practices.

## Enforcement and Compliance

21) Failure to comply with the password policy may can result in
    disciplinary action.

22) Disciplinary action is decided on a case-by-case basis, and
    ultimately to the supervisor's discretion.

23) Disciplinary action may include termination of contract or employer.

24) The IT department will regularly audit password practices and
    systems to ensure compliance with the policy.

# Part 3 Reviews

## Review and Revision

25) The policy must undergo annual reviews, or as necessitated by
    changes in security threats, or organisational requirements.

26) Policy changes and amendments are to be communicated with all
    relevant personnel and incorporated into training programs.

## Approval

27) This policy is (assumed) approved by Product Owner Kelvin Li and
    Project Mentor Samantha Petri and is effective from 29/03/2024.
